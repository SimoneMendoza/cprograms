Hi, my name is John. I wrote a story called Silly Tales of Crayons, about daring crayons travelling to places from going to outer space to being in the jungle with monkeys. In this story, there are four crayons, a red one, a blue one, a green one, and a yellow one. They all love space so much that they journey to the bathroom. There they find a toothbrush and they use it as a spaceship to the moon. The crayon friends blast off, but not to the moon. Instead, they blast off to the bathtub. The crayons think it is the moon and for somewhat reason, water carries them down the drain. They panic because they think that they are being sucked into a black hole. So they have an adventure of a life time. They walk down the sewer path, meeting rats and crocodiles, helping them by giving them a ride on their backs. After a while, they hear a strange noise. It seems very familiar. When they turn around, they find their spaceship, flowing down the muddy river. They are happy. The crayons walk a few more feet before they reach light. Right above them was a manhole that was not completely closed, but large enough for them to escape. They counted down and blasted out into the air outside. There is still enough energy to make it back to their crayon home. So in the cool breeze the crayons flew, leaving bubbles behind them like a snail trail. By the time the sun was high in the blue sky, the red, blue, green, and yellow crayons make back into the bathroom to land the spaceship. Quietly, they hop to the room with their snug crayon box home and fall fast asleep, thinking about the adventure they just had.
